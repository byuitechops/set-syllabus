        <h2>Course description</h2>
        <p>An effective English teacher must use the language well, know how the language works, be able to explain language rules to students, and be familiar with the various principles and methodologies for best sharing this knowledge. Our class will focus on the structure of the English language in significant detail so that you will gain a deeper understanding of how it works. The material will be presented in a way that will invite you to ponder how various aspects of English compare with those of your native language. Application of this knowledge will allow students to evaluate and address language deficiencies, identify resources useful in furthering language learning, and follow a program of lifelong language learning.</p>
